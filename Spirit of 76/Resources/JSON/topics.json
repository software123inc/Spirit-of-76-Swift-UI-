Thus the patriot heart of America, at this crisis (1773), beat as with one pulsation, and the public mind was fully prepared to act with promptness and decision when circumstances should call for action.\n\nMr. Lee is doubtless due the credit of first suggesting the system of 'Committees of Correspondence,' although Virginia and Massachusetts both claim the honor of publicly proposing the measure first. So far as that claim is concerned, the proposition was almost simultaneous in the Assembly of both Provinces. It was proposed in the Virginia Assembly, on the twelfth of March, 1773, by Dabney Carr, a brother-in-law of Mr. Jefferson, and a young man of brilliant talents. The plan, however, was fixed on in a caucus at the 'Raleigh Tavern,' and Richard Henry Lee was one of the number.

            "notes":"Mr. John Dickenson was, at the time of the Revolution, one of the most eminent lawyers in America. He was a powerful writer, and his Letters of a Pennsylvania Farmer were very instrumental in bringing on that crisis in public affairs in the Colonies which brought about the Revolution. He was always opposed to the proposition for independence, and would have voted against it if he had been in his seat on the fourth of July, 1776. His earnest desire was to obtain justice for America, without dismembering the British empire.",

She also appointed a minister (Mr. Gerard) to Congress, and he came with the French fleet, and was landed at Sandy Hook, in July of that year.",

            "notes":"It has been said that the paragraph commencing the with the words 'He has waged a cruel war against human nature itself,' etc., was not palatable to those delegates who were slave-holders, and that it was stricken out lest it should be a cause for them to cast a negative vote on the question. But there is not the least shadow of evidence to prove that such selfish motives guided any one in that august assembly. On the contrary, it was high and holy regard for truth and justice, which caused that eloquent paragraph to be stricken out.\n\nThe Congress in that Declaration was enumerating those aggressions against the rights and privileges of the colonies, justly chargeable upon George III as an individual, having been done by his personal sanction, or by his delegated representatives. Such being the case, it was manifestly unjust, indeed not strictly true, to charge him with the evils concomitant to slavery and the slave-trade. This trade was begun and carried on long before the reign of even the first George; and it is not known that George III ever gave his assent to anything relating to slavery, except to abolish it and declare the trade a piracy."
