			<string>When Captain Preston and his men were arraigned for murder, Mr. Adams was asked to act as counsel in their defense. Popular favor on one side, and the demands of justice on one side, and humanity on the other presented Mr. Adams with a dilemma, though he was not long in choosing. He accepted the invitation -- he defended the prisoners successfully -- Captain Preston was acquitted, and notwithstanding the tremendous excitement that existed against the soldiers, the patriotism of Mr. Adams was too far above suspicion to make this defense of the enemy a cause for withdrawing from him the confidence which the people placed in him. His friends applauded him for the act, and the people were satisfied, as was evident by their choosing him, that same year (1770), to be a representative in the provincial Assembly.</string>

			<string>Mr. Adams constantly watched the moves of the British government, and spent a great deal of time in talking and writing in favor of the resistance of the Colonies to the oppressions of the crown and its ministers. He took a firm and decided stand against the Stamp Act and its antecedent kindred schemes to tax the Colonies. As early as 1763, he boldly expressed his sentiments relative to the rights and privileges of the Colonists; and in some instructions which he drew up for the guidance of the Boston members of the General Assembly, in that year, he denied the right of Parliament to tax the Colonies without their consent -- denied the supremacy of Parliament, and suggested a union of all the Colonies, as necessary for their protection against British aggressions.</string>

			<string>Governor Huntington lived the life of the irreproachable and sincere Christian, and those who knew him most intimately, loved him the most affectionately. He was a thoughtful man, and talked but little -- the expression of his mind and heart was put forth into his actions. He seemed to have a natural timidity, or modesty, which some mistook for the reserve of haughtiness, yet with those with whom he was familiar, he was free and winning in his manners. Investigation was a prominent characteristic of his mind, and when this faculty led him to a conclusion, it was difficult to turn him from the path of his determination. Hence as a devoted Christian and a true patriot, he never swerved from duty, or looked back after he placed his hand to the work. The cultivation of this faculty of decision we would earnestly recommend to youth, for it is the strong arm that will lead them safely through many difficulties, and win for them that sentiment of reliance in the minds of others, which is so essential in securing their esteem and confidence. It was this most important faculty which constituted the chief aid to Samuel Huntington in his progress from the humble calling of a ploughboy, to the acme of official station, where true greatness was essential, and to which non but the truly good aspire.</string>

Louzon, one of Rochambeau's cavalry officers, encamped during the winter with his legion at Lebanon, and Mr. Williams, in order to allow the officers comfortable quarters, relinquished his own house to them, and moved his family to another.</string>

			<string>Mr. Floyd always enjoyed robust health, and he retained his mental faculties in their wonted vigor until the last. His life was a long and active one; and, as a thorough business man, his services proved of great public utility during the stormy times of the Revolution, and the no less tempestuous and dangerous period when our government was settling down upon its present steadfast basis. Decision was a leading feature in his character, and trifling obstacles never thwarted his purposes when his opinion and determination were fixed. And let it be remembered that this noble characteristic, decision, was a prominent one with all of that sacred band who signed the charter of our emancipation, and that without this, men cannot be truly great, or eminently useful.</string>

			<string>Philip Livingston was descended from a Scotch minister of the gospel, of exemplary character, who, in 1663 left Scotland and settled in Rotterdam, where he died. His son, Robert (the father of Philip) soon after his father's decease, emigrated to America, and, under the patroon privileges, obtained a grand of a large tract of land upon the Hudson River (now in Columbia County), ever since known as Livingston's Manor. He had three sons, Philip was the oldest, and who became, on the death of his father, heir to the manor. The other two sons, Robert and Gilbert, were influential men at that time. The former was the father of Chancellor Livingston, who administered the inaugural oath to Washington in 1789; and the later was the father of the Reverend John Livingston, D. D., President of Rutger's College, New Jersey.</string>

			<string>For some time previous to the Revolution, nearly all the Colonies had resident agents in England. The celebrated Edmund Burke was the agent for New York when the war broke out, and it is believed that his enlightened views of American affairs, as manifested in his brilliant speeches in Parliament in defense of the Colonies, were derived from his long continued and constant correspondence with Philip Livingston, who was appointed one of a committee of the New York Assembly, for that purpose. He was very influential in that body, and early took a decided stand against the unrighteous acts of Great Britain.</string>

			<string>Mr. Morris was a handsome man; and his personal appearance, connected with a strong intellect and great wealth, made him popular throughout the Colony. When Great Britain oppressed her children here, he hardly felt the unkind hand, yet his sympathy for others was aroused, and he was among the first to risk ease, reputation and fortune, by coalescing with the patriots Massachusetts and Virginia. His clear perception saw the end from the beginning, and those delusive hopes which the repeal of obnoxious acts held forth, had no power over Lewis Morris. Neither could they influence his patriotism, for he was a stranger to a vacillating, temporizing spirit. He refused office under the Colonial government, for his domestic ease and comfort were paramount to the ephemeral enjoyments of place. Hence, when he forsook his quiet hearth, and engaged in the party strife of the Revolution, hazarding fortune and friends, no sinister motive could be alleged for his actions, and all regarded him as a patriot without selfish alloy. He looked upon war with the mother-country as inevitable, and so boldly expressed his opinion on these subjects, that the still rather lukewarm Colony of New York did not think proper to send him as a delegate to the General Congress of 1774. But the feelings of the people changed, and in April, 1775, Mr. Lewis was elected a member of the second Congress that met in May following.</string>

			<string>Soon after his return from inspecting the army of General Schuyler, Mr. Stockton was obliged to hasten to his family to prevent their capture by the British army, then pursuing Washington and his little band across New Jersey (after the success of Cornwallis in capturing Fort Washington, on York Island, Washington crossed the Hudson with the main army of Americans, and for three weeks he was closely pursued by the British General across New Jersey to Trenton, where the memorable crossing of the Delaware took place). He removed them to the house of a friend about thirty miles distant, but there he was captured by a party of refugees, who were guided to his retreat by a treacherous neighbor of his friend. He remained a prisoner for some time, and, on account of his position as one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, he was treated with great severity. He was first placed in the common jail at Amboy, and afterward he was carried to the old Provost prison in New York, which stood where the present Hall of Records in the Park now stands. The hardships he endured shattered his constitution. He suffered greatly form the cold, and at one time he was kept twenty-four hours without a particle of food. Congress took up his cause, and threatened Lord Howe with retaliation upon British prisoners. This had its effect, and he was soon afterward exchanged.

After his release, when he found himself almost a beggar, through the vandalism of the British in destroying his estate, he was seized with a despondency from which he never recovered. A cancer in his neck also hurried him toward the grave, and he died in the fifty-first year of his age.</string>

A majority of his poetical effusions were of an ephemeral nature, and were forgotten, in a degree, with the occasion which called them forth; yet a few have been preserved, among which is The Battle of the Kegs, a ballad, or sort of epic, of inimitable humor.

A knowledge of his superior talents having reached the ears of the British ministers, he was appointed to a lucrative office in the State of New Jersey, soon after his marriage to Miss Ann Borden. This he held until his republican principles were too manifest, by both word and deed, for the minions of British power to mistake, and he was deprived of his office.</string>

			<string>Nothing would have seemed more inimical to Mr. Hart's private interests, than this act, which was the harbinger of open hostilities, for his estate was peculiarly exposed to the fury of the enemy. Nor was that fury withheld when New Jersey was invaded by the British and their mercenary allies, the Hessians. This signers of the Declaration everywhere were marked for vengeance, and when the enemy made their conquering descent upon New Jersey, Mr. Hart's estate was among the first to feel the effects of the desolating inroad. Mr. Hart's family, having timely warning of the approach of the enemy in pursuit of Washington, fled to a place of safety. His farm was ravaged, his timber destroyed, his cattle and sock butchered for the use of the British army, and he himself was hunted like a noxious beast, not daring to remain two nights under the same roof. And it was not until Washington's success at the battle of Trenton, that this dreadful state of himself and his family was ended.

The blight fell, not only upon his fortune, but upon his person, and he did not live to see the sunlight of Peace and Independence gladden the face of his country. He died in the year 1780, the gloomiest period of the War of Independence, full of years and deserved honors.</string>

He had witnessed so much of the cruelty and oppressions of Great Britain, in her war upon the declared freedom of the Colonies, that his feelings of hatred could not be soothed by the treaty of peace, although he patriotically acquiesced in whatever tended to his country's good. He therefore took sides with France when questions concerning her came up in Congress; and, early in 1794, he laid before Congress a resolution for suspending all intercourse with Great Britain, until every item of the treaty of peace should be complied with.

It was a service which no other man in the country seemed competent to perform, and that Congress well knew. His business talent, and his extensive credit at home and abroad, were brought to bear in this vocation, and upon him alone, for a long time, rested the labor of supplying a famished and naked army and furnishing other necessary supplies for the public service. Congress, at that time, could not have obtained a loan of one thousand dollars, yet Robert Morris effected loans upon his own credit, of tens of thousands. The Bank of North America was put in successful operation, and there is no doubt that these patriotic services of Robert Morris present the chief reason why the Continental army was not at that time disbanded by its own act. And it has been justly remarked, that: 'If it were not demonstrable by official records, posterity would hardly be made to believe that the campaign of 1781, which resulted in the capture of Cornwallis, and virtually closed the Revolutionary War, was sustained wholly on the credit of an individual merchant.'</string>

			<string>At the time Washington was preparing, in his camp upon the Hudson, in Westchester county, to attack Sir Henry Clinton in New York, in 1781, Mr. Morris and Judge Peters of Pennsylvania were then at headquarters. Washington received a letter from Count de Grasse, announcing his determination not to sail to New York. He was bitterly disappointed, but almost before the cloud passed from his brow, he conceived the expedition against Cornwallis at Yorktown.

'Let me know the sum you desire,' said Mr. Morris; and before noon Washington's plan and estimates were complete. Mr. Morris promised him the amount, and he raised it upon his own responsibility.</string>

			<string>By his liberal expenditures and free proffers of his private obligations for the public benefit, he found his ample fortune very much diminished at the close of hostilities; and by embarking the remainder in the purchase of wild lands, in the State of New York, under the impression that emigrants from the old world would flow in a vast and ceaseless current to the 'land of the free,' he became greatly embarrassed in his pecuniary affairs, and it preyed seriously on his mind. This misfortune, and the inroads which asthma had made upon his constitution, proved a canker at the root of his bodily vigor, and he sunk to rest in the grave in the seventy-third year of his age, leaving a widow (Mary White, sister of the late venerable Bishop White of PA) with whom he had lived in uninterrupted domestic happiness for thirty-seven years.</string>

			<string>Doctor Rush's eminent qualities as a medical practitioner, a philanthropist, and a Christian, were fully developed when the yellow fever rapidly depopulated Philadelphia, in 1793. It was so malignant, that all the usual remedies failed, and the best medical skill was completely foiled. Many physicians became alarmed for their own safety and flex from the city; but Doctor Rush, and a few of his attached pupils and friends, remained to aid the sick and dying, and if possible, check the march of the destroyer. He at length had a severe attack of the fever, and some of his pupils fell victims; but so long as he was able to get from his bed, he did not remit his labors.

He and a few of his noble-hearted pupils remained and performed their duty faithfully. His written description of that dreadful epidemic, is one of the most thrilling pieces of composition in our language.</string>

			<string>As a patriot, Doctor Rush was firm and inflexible; as a professional man he was skilful, candid, and honorable; as a thinker and writer, he was profound; as a Christian, zealous and consistent; and in his domestic relations, he was the centre of a circle of love and true affection. Through life the Bible was a lamp to his feet -- his guide in all things appertaining to his duty toward God and man. Amid all his close and arduous pursuit of human knowledge, he never neglected to 'search the Scriptures' for that knowledge which points the soul aright in its journey to the Spirit Land. His belief in revealed religion, and in the Divine inspiration of the Sacred Writers, manifested in many of his scientific productions; and during that period, at the close of the eighteenth century, when the sentiments of infidel France were infused into the minds of men in high places here, Doctor Rush's principles stood firm, and his opinions never wavered.

The life of this truly great man terminated when he was in the sixty-eighth year of his age. During his last illness, the public mind was greatly affected, and his house was constantly thronged with people inquiring concerning the probable result of the disease that was upon him. When death closed his eyes, every citizen felt that a dear friend had been taken away, and a general gloom overspread the community.</string>

The attempt at conciliation proved abortive, and hostilities commenced. Franklin had formed a personal acquaintance with Lord Howe while in England. At the conference in question, when his lordship expressed his kind feelings toward the Americans, and his great regret that they would not share in the protection of British power, Doctor Franklin told him plainly that he not give himself any trouble on their account as the Americans were full able to take care of themselves.

Great Britain at length yielded to American will, and consented to negotiate a treaty of peace upon the basis of American independence; and on the third day of September, 1783, Doctor Franklin had the pleasure of signing a definitive treaty to that effect. It was on this occasion, that Doctor Franklin again put on a suit of clothes which ten years before, on the occasion of his being insulted before the English Privy Council, he declared he would never wear again until he had 'signed England's degradation and America's independence.'</string>

			<string>Mr. Braxton was not a brilliant man, but he was a talented and very useful one. He possessed a highly cultivated mind, and an imagination of peculiar warmth and vigor, yet the crowning attribute of his character, was sound judgment and remarkable prudence and forethought. These, in a movement like the American Revolution, were essential elements in the characters of those who were the prominent actors, and well was it for them and for posterity, that a large proportion of not only the Signers to the Declaration of Independence, but those who were called to act in the councils of the nation, possessed these requisites to a remarkable degree. While 'fiery spirits' were needed to arouse, and bold, energetic men were necessary to control and guide, the success of that rebellion, so far as human knowledge can penetrate, depended upon the calm judgment and well directed prudence of a great body of the patriots.

 Of this class Mr. Braxton was a prominent one. His oratory, though not brilliant, was graceful and flowing, and it was persuasive in the highest degree. He always fixed the attention of his auditors and seldom failed to convince and lead them. In public, as well as in private life, his virtue and morality were above reproach, and as a public benefactor, his death was widely lamented.</string>

 The Stamp Act aroused the energies of his soul to do battle for his country's right, and he was among the first in Maryland who lifted up voice and hand against the oppressor. He was one of a band of young patriots, who, in imitation of those of Massachusetts, styled themselves 'Sons of Liberty.' They opposed the operation of the vile Stamp Act in every form, and even went so far as to assault the Stamp Offices, and destroy the Stamps. He became obnoxious to the authorities of Annapolis, and they attempted, by degrading epithets, to crush his eagle spirit while yet a fledgling.

			<string>Mr. Gwinnett favored the opposition of the Colonies to British oppression, to some degree, yet he was one of those cautious, doubting men at that time, who viewed the success of the colonies in an open rupture with the home government, as highly problematical. Therefore, when, in 1774, Georgia was solicited to unite her voice with the other colonies in a General Congress, Mr. Gwinnett looked upon the proposition with disfavor, as one fraught with danger and many evils. But falling in with Doctor Lyman Hall, and a few other decided patriots, his judgment became gradually convinced that some powerful movement was necessary, and at length he came out before the people, as one of the warmest advocates of unbending resistance to the British Crown. His cultivated mind and superior talents rendered him very popular with the people as soon as he espoused their cause, and every honor in their gift was speedily bestowed upon him.</string>

			<string>Soon after the State Convention adjourned, Mr. Bullock, the president of the council, died, and Mr. Gwinnett was elected to that station, then the highest office in the gift of the people. The civil honors, so rapidly and lavishly bestowed upon him, excited his ambition, and while he was a representative in Congress, he aspired to the possession of military honors also. He offered himself as a candidate for the office of Brigadier General, and his competitor was Colonel McIntosh, a man highly esteemed for his manly bearing and courageous disposition. Mr. Gwinnett was defeated, and with mistaken views he looked upon his rival as a personal enemy. A decided alienation of their former friendship took place, and the breach was constantly widened by the continued irritations which Mr. Gwinnett experienced at the hands of Colonel M'Intosh and his friends. At length he was so excited by the conduct of his opposers [sic], and goaded by the thoughts of having his fair fame tarnished in the eyes of the community, from whom he had received his laurels, that he listened to the suggestions of false honor, and challenged Colonel M'Intosh to single combat. They met with pistols, and at the first fire both were wounded, Mr. Gwinnett mortally; and in the prime of life, at the early age of forty-five, his life terminated. He could well have said, in the language of the lamented Hamilton, when fatally wounded in a duel by Aaron Burr: 'I have lived like a man, but I die like a fool.'</string>

			<string>Native born Englishmen were in the habit of regarding the colonists as inferior to themselves, and they were apt to assume a bearing toward them highly offensive. In some degree Mr. Gwinnett was obnoxious and guilty of this charge, and he looked upon his rapid elevation in public life, as an acknowledgment of his superiority. These feelings were too thinly covered not to be seen by the people when he was president of the council, and it soon engendered among the natives a jealousy that was fully reciprocated by him. This was doubtless the prime cause of all the difficulties which surrounded him toward the close of his life, and brought him to his tragical [sic] death.

 Mr. Gwinnett left a wife and several children, but they did not long survive him.</string>

			<string>Doctor Hall was a close observer of the 'signs of the times,' and he was among the earliest of the southern patriots who lifted up their voices against British oppression and misrule. The community in which he lived was strongly imbued with the same feeling, for the people brought with them from New England the cherished principles of the Pilgrim Fathers-principles that would not brook attempts to enslave, or even to destroy a single prerogative of the colonies. The older settlers of Georgia, many of whom were direct from Europe, had these principles of freedom inwoven [sic] with their character in a much less degree, and therefore the parish of St. John, wherein Doctor Hall resided, seemed, at the first cry of liberty, to have all the patriotism of the province centered there.

 During the summer, Georgia became sufficiently aroused to come out as a colony in favor of the republican cause, and at a convention of the people held in Savannah, in July, five delegates to Congress were elected, of whom Doctor Hall was one. He presented his new credentials in May 1776, and he took part in the debates which ensued on the motion of Mr. Lee for Independence. Doctor Hall warmly supported it, and voted for it on the fourth of July. He signed the Declaration on the second of August, and soon afterward returned home for a season.</string>

He arrived there in time to remove them, but was obliged to leave his property entirely exposed to the fury of the foe. He went north, and while the British had possession of the state, and revived royal authority in government there, his property was confiscated. He returned to Georgia, in 1782, just before the enemy evacuated Savannah.</string>

			<string>While in England, Mr. Hayward, became deeply impressed with the injustice of the prevailing feeling there, that a colonial British subject was quite inferior (and should be treated as such) to the native born Englishman. Such was the sentiment of society, and upon this sentiment, the government seemed to act by appointing to office in the colonies few but natives of the British Islands; and in its carelessness of the rights and privileges of the colonists, as if they were not equally protected by the broad aegis of the British Constitution. These things, even at that early age, alienated his affection from the mother country, and he returned to his native land with mortified feelings, and a heartfelt desire to free it from the bondage of transatlantic rule.

 Before returning to America, Mr. Hayward visited several of the states of Europe, and instead of being dazzled by the pomp and trappings of royalty and its minions, he looked upon them all as the costly and bloodstained fruit of wrong and oppression; and he saw in the toiling, downtrodden millions of the producers, such a contrast to the happy laborers of his own dear land, that he felt an affection for his country of the tenderest [sic] nature, and his patriotism took deep root, even while he stood before the throne of royal rulers.</string>

			<string>Mr. Hooper formed a circle of very polished acquaintances in North Carolina, and he soon became highly esteemed among the literary men of the province. He rose rapidly in his profession, and in a very short time he stood at the head of the bar in that region. He was greatly esteemed by the officers of the government, and his success in the management of several causes, in which the government was his client, gave him much influence.

 When, in 1770-1771, an insurrectionary movement was set on foot by a party of the people termed the Regulators, Mr. Hooper took sides with the government, and advised and assisted Governor Tryon in all his measures to suppress the rebellion. For this, he was branded as a royalist, and even when he openly advocated the cause of the patriots, he was for a time viewed with some suspicion lest his professions were unreal. But those who knew him best, knew well how strongly and purely burned that flame of patriotism which his zealous instructor, Mr. Otis, had lighted in his bosom; and his consistent course in public life, attested his sincerity.</string>

His grandfather settled in Chesterfield, and had three sons, Thomas, Field, and Peter. The latter married Jane, daughter of Isham Randolph, of Goochland, of Scotch descent; and on the thirteenth of April 1743. They resided at that time at Shadwell, in Albermarle county, Virginia. Thomas was the eldest of their children. His father died when he was fourteen years old, leaving a widow and eight children-two sons, and six daughters. He left a handsome estate to his family; and the lands, which he called Monticello, fell to Thomas, where the latter always resided when not engaged in public duty, and where he lived at the time of his death.</string>

			<string>Congress having resolved not to suffer the prisoners captured at Saratoga, under Burgoyne, to leave the United States until the convention, entered into by Gates and Burgoyne, should be ratified by the British government, they were divided, and sent to the different States, to be provided for during the interval. A division of them was sent, early in 1779, into the interior of Virginia, near the residence of Mr. Jefferson; and his benevolent feelings were strongly exhibited by his sympathy for these enemies of his country. The prisoners were in great distress, and Mr. Jefferson and his friends did all in their power to alleviate their sufferings. An apprehended scarcity of provisions, determined Governor Patrick Henry to remove them to another part of the State, or out of it entirely. At this the officers and men were greatly distressed, and Mr. Jefferson wrote a touching appeal to the governor in their behalf; and they were allowed to remain.

The officers and soldiers were very grateful to Mr. Jefferson, and when they were about to depart for England, the former united in a letter of thanks to him. Mr. Jefferson, in reply, disclaimed the performance of any great service to them, as said: 'Opposed as we happen to be in our sentiments of duty and honor and anxious for contrary events, I shall, nevertheless, sincerely rejoice in every circumstance of happiness and safety which you may attend you personally.'</string>

			<string>In the spring of 1826, his bodily infirmities greatly increased, and in June he was confined wholly to his bed. About the first of July he seemed free from disease, and his friends had hopes of his recovery; but it was his own conviction that he should die, and he gave directions accordingly. On the third, he inquired the day of the month. On being told, he expressed an ardent desire to live until the next day, to breathe the air of the fiftieth anniversary of his country's independence. His wish was granted: and on the morning of the fourth, after having expressed his gratitude to his friends and servants for their care, he said with a distinct voice, 'I resign myself to my God, and my child to my country.' These were his last words, and about noon on that glorious day he expired. It was a. most remarkable coincidence that two of the committee (Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson) who drew up the Declaration of Independence; who signed it; who successively held the office of Chief Magistrate, should have died at nearly the same hour on the fiftieth anniversary of that solemn act.

 Just before he died, he handed Mrs. Randolph, whom he tenderly loved, a morocco case, with a request that she would not open it until after his decease. It contained a poetical tribute to her virtues, and an epitaph for his tomb, if any should be placed upon it.

He was exceedingly kind and benevolent, an indulgent master to his servants, liberal and friendly to his neighbors.

 In religion he was a freethinker; in morals, pure and unspotted; in politics, patriotic, honest, ardent and benevolent. Respecting his political character, there was (and still is) a great diversity of opinion, and we are not yet far enough removed from the theatre of his acts to judge of them dispassionately and justly. His life was devoted to his country; the result of his acts whatever it may be, is a legacy to mankind.</string>

			<string>Mr. Lee's fearlessness and independence of spirit, as well as his eloquence, were soon afterward manifested when he undertook the task of calling to account Mr. Robinson, the delinquent treasurer of the colony. A large number of the members of the House of Burgesses, who belonged to the old aristocracy of Virginia, were men, who, by extravagance and dissipation, had wasted their estates, and resorted to the ruinous practice of borrowing to keep up an expensive style of living not warranted by their reduced means. Nearly all of them had borrowed money of Mr. Robinson, and he had even gone so far as to lend them treasury notes, already redeemed, which it was his duty to destroy, to secure the public against loss. He believed that their influence and number in the House of Burgesses, would screen him from punishment, supposing there were none hardy enough to array himself against them. But Mr. Lee did array himself against all that corrupt power, and in the prosecution of the delinquent treasurer, carried his point successfully.</string>

			<string>Mr. Lee fearlessly expressed his sentiments of reprobation of the course pursued by the British Government toward the colonies, and he organized the first association in Virginia for opposing British oppression in that colony, when it came in the form of the Stamp Act. He was the first man in Virginia, who stood publicly forth in opposition to the execution of that measure, and although by birth, education and social station, he ranked with the aristocracy, he was foremost in breaking down those distinctions between the wealthy class and the 'common people,' as those self-constituted patricians called those who labored with their hands. Associated with him, was the powerful Patrick Henry, whose stormy eloquence strongly contrasted with the sweet-toned and persuasive rhetoric of Lee, but when they united their power the shock was always irresistible.</string>

			<string>Mr. Lee was very active in promoting the prevalence of non-importation agreements; and when he heard, through his brother, of the Boston Port Bill, he drew up a series of condemnatory resolutions to present to the Virginia Assembly (One of these resolutions proposed the calling of a General Congress, but even the warmest partisans thought this measure altogether too rash to be thought of.). The Governor heard of them, and dissolved the Assembly before the resolutions could be introduced. Of course this act of royal power greatly exasperated the people, and instead of checking the ball that Mr. Lee had put in motion, it accelerated its, speed. The controversy between the Governor and representatives here begun, continued, and the breach grew wider and wider, until at length, in August 1774, a convention of delegates of the people assembled at Williamsburgh [sic], in despite of the Governor's proclamation, and appointed Richard Henry Lee, Patrick Henry, George Washington, and Peyton Randolph, to the General Congress called to meet in Philadelphia on the fifth of September, following. In that Congress, Mr. Lee was one of the prime movers, and his convincing and persuasive eloquence nerved the timid to act and speak out boldly for the rights of the colonists. His conduct there made a profound impression upon the public mind, and he stood before his countrymen as one of the brightest lights of the age.</string>

			<string>Long before non-importation agreements were proposed, Mr. Lee practiced the measure. In order to show the people of Great Britain that America was really independent of them in matters of luxury, as well as necessity, he cultivated native grapes, and produced most excellent wine. He sent several bottles to his friends in Great Britain, 'to testify his respect and gratitude for those who had shown particular kindness to Americans.' He told them that it was the production of his own hills; and he ordered his merchant in London, who had before furnished his wine, not to send any more, nor any other articles on which Parliament had imposed a duty to be paid by Americans.</string>

			<string>Mr. Lee continued an active and indefatigable member of Congress until 1779, when, as lieutenant of the county of Westmoreland, he entered the field at the head of the militia, in defense of his State. He was occasionally absent from Congress on account of his health, and once on account of being charged with Toryism, because he received his rents in produce, instead of the depreciated continental currency. He demanded and obtained an investigation before the Virginia Assembly, and it resulted in the passage of a resolution of thanks for his many services in and out of Congress, and by his immediate reelection to a seat there.</string>

			<string>His last days were crowned with all the honor and reverence which a grateful people could bestow upon a benefactor, and when death cut his thread of life, a nation truly mourned. He sunk to his final rest on the nineteenth day of June, 1794, in the sixty-fourth year of his age.

 Richard Henry Lee was a scion of the noblest stock of Virginia gentlemen. Should ancestral dignity and renown add anything to the coronal that enwreathes the urn of his memory, it is fully entitled to it, for his relations for several generations were distinguished for wealth, intellect and virtue.</string>

			<string>Robert R. Livingston was of noble lineage -- noble, not only by royal patent, but in high and virtuous deeds. James Livingston, about the middle of the sixteenth century, was appointed Regent of Scotland, during the minority of James I. A grand-daughter of this Livingston married Donald, king of the Hebrides. Several members of the family had distinct titles; one was Earl of Newburgh, another Earl of Linlithgow, another Earl of Callander, and another Earl of Livingstone. The latter was the common ancestor of the branch of the family that emigrated to America. He was hereditary governor of Linlithgow Castle, in which Mary, Queen of Scots, was born, and his daughter was one of the four ladies who attended Mary to France, as her companions. The grandson of Lord Livingston, who was an eminent divine, emigrated to Rotterdam, in 1663, in consequence of the religious persecutions in Scotland, and he was one of the commissioners in the negotiations for that peace, which eventuated in the transfer of the colony of New York from the states of Holland to England. His son Robert emigrated to America, in 1678, and in 1686 he obtained a patent for the Manor of Livingston, upon the Hudson river, in Columbia County, New York. He was afterward chiefly instrumental, in a conference with King William and others, in causing the expedition which was fitted out against the pirates that infested the American coast. Captain Kidd was appointed the agent in the enterprise, but through the connivance as is supposed, of Governor Fletcher, of New York, he became a greater pirate himself than those he came to subdue. Robert R. Livingston, our subject, was the great-grandson of Robert, the first proprietor of the Livingston manor.</string>

			<string>In 1801, Chancellor Livingston was appointed by President Jefferson, minister to the court of France, at the head of which was then the young conqueror of Italy, Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul of the French Republic. He at once won the esteem and confidence of that great captain, and successfully negotiated with his ministers for the purchase of Louisiana, then in possession of France.

 The treaty was signed in April 1802, by Mr. Livingston and Mr. Monroe, on the part of the United States, and by the Count de Marbois in behalf of France. When it was signed, Mr. Livingston arose from his seat and with solemn and prophetic voice said, 'We have lived long, but this is the noblest work of our whole lives. The treaty which we have just signed has not been obtained by art or dictated by force; equally advantageous to both contracting parties, it will change vast solitudes into flourishing districts. From this day the United States take their place among the powers of the first rank; the English lose all exclusive influence in the affairs of America.' Napoleon, too, spoke prophetically. 'This accession of territory,' said he, 'strengthens for ever the power of the United States; and I have given to England a maritime rival, that will sooner or later humble her pride.'</string>

Science, too, claimed his attention, and the aid and encouragement which he rendered Robert Fulton in his steamboat experiments, by which they were made successful, form an imperishable monument of honor to his memory. Agriculture was his study and delight, and to him the farmers of this country are indebted for the introduction of gypsum, or plaster, for manure, and the clover grass.</string>

			<string>Chancellor Livingston was the only man of influence who seemed to appreciate the character of Fulton's genius, and sympathize with him in his efforts to render steam subservient to purposes of navigation. He warmly entered into all his plans, fully comprehended his theories, and was convinced at the outset of the practicability of the project. He had himself made many advances in the same road with Mr. Fulton, before he became acquainted with him. He applied to the Legislature of New York, in 1798, for a special act, giving him the exclusive right to navigate the waters of the Hudson river with boats 'propelled by fire or steam' for twenty years. Dr. Samuel Mitchell, then in the House of Assembly, introduced a bill accordingly, and it brought down upon him an avalanche of ridicule; and the debates which arose upon it were amusing in the extreme. It is said that when any of the younger members wished to indulge in a little fun, they would call up Dr. Mitchell's 'hot water bill,' and handy their jokes without stint. Many of the older members declared that the project of propelling vessels by steam was too preposterous to be seriously thought of; and was unworthy of being dignified by legislative action. But an act granting the privilege was finally passed; yet the experiments of Mr. Livingston were not sufficiently successful to warrant him to build a boat of any considerable size. For a while he abandoned the scheme, and it was not until after his return from France, whither Mr. Jefferson sent him as minister, that he resumed his experiments. He became acquainted with Mr. Fulton in Paris, and on his return to the United States, they united their interests and their talents, and produced a boat, in 1807, which was propelled by steam from New York to Albany, at the rate of five miles an hour.

 The first trip which this boat made was one of intense interest to Fulton and his warmhearted colleague, Chancellor Livingston. A few doubting friends ventured on board, and when the boat left the wharf; they almost wished themselves again on shore, for they felt the jeers of the crowd that huzzaed for 'Fulton's folly' as the vessel moved out into the stream. On she went some distance up the river and stopped! 'Just as I expected' was the feeling of all, and the expression of many. But Fulton's confidence was not shaken; he discovered the cause and the boat moved on. They reached the Taappan Sea, glided through Haverstraw Bay, and at length entered the great amphitheater of the Highlands at Caldwell's. Onward moved the mysterious vessel. West Point was passed, magnificent Newburgh Bay was entered, the green fields of Duchess and Columbia, and the towering peaks of the Catskills were passed, and Albany was reached. The victory was complete -- science vindicated the claims of Genius, and a new creation of the western world began. Now the fruits of that victory are seen world wide, and the achievements of Fulton and Livingston on that day are how honored as having given an almost omnipotent scepter to civilization.</string>

			<string>Chancellor Livingston continued actively engaged in public life until a year or so before his death, which occurred at his country-seat at Clermont, on the twenty-sixth day of February, 1813, when he was in the sixty-sixth year of his age. He was a prominent actor in scenes which present features of the most remarkable kind, as influencing the destinies of the world. His pen, like his oratory, was chaste and classical; and the latter, because of its purity and ease, obtained for him from the lips of Doctor Franklin, the title of the Cicero of America. And to all of his eminent virtues and attainments he added that of a sincere and devoted Christian, the crowning attribute in the character of a good and great man.</string>

He was a descendant of an ancient Austrian family, natives of the town of Lintz. A branch of the family moved to England, and settled in the county of Kent. Thence they went to Connaught in Ireland, and it was from that place that the great-grandfather of our subject emigrated to America and settled in South Carolina, a short time after its first settlement. He purchased large tracts of land, and when they fell into the possession of the father of Thomas Lynch, junior, they possessed great value, and gave him a splendid fortune.</string>

			<string>Mr. Lynch did not long remain in Congress, for the declining health of both himself and his father caused him to resign his seat and return home. They travelled slowly until they reached Annapolis, where his father had another paralytic stroke, which terminated his life. With a sad heart and debilitated frame, the bereaved son returned home. But the canker of disease was preying upon his vitals, and by the advice of physicians, he resolved to go to the south of Europe, with the faint hope, that restored health might be the result. It being perilous at that time to go in an American vessel, he sailed for the West Indies toward the close of 1779, with the expectation of finding a neutral vessel there, in which to embark for Europe. His affectionate wife accompanied him, but they never reached their destination. The vessel was supposed to have foundered at sea, and all on board perished, for it was never heard of afterward.

 Thus, at the early age of thirty years, terminated the life of one of that sacred band who pledged life, fortune and honor, in defense of American freedom. Like a brilliant meteor, he beamed with splendor for a short period, and suddenly vanished forever.</string>

			<string>He and his wife returned from Europe in 1773, and, by the indulgence of his father, he took the family seat for his residence. There in the possession of wealth and every domestic enjoyment, he had bright prospect of worldly happiness. But even then the dark clouds of the Revolution were gathering, and in less than two years the storm burst upon the South, as well as all along the Atlantic seaboard, with great fury. Men could not remain neutral, for there was no middle course, and Arthur Middleton, as well as his father, laid their lives and fortunes upon the altar of patriotism. When the decision was made and the die was cast, Mr. Middleton laid aside domestic ease and entered at once upon active life. He was a member of one of the committees of safety of South Carolina, appointed by the Provincial Congress in 1775. In that body he was firm and unyielding in principle, and when, soon afterward, Lord William Campbell was appointed governor, and it was discovered that he was acting with duplicity, Mr. Middleton laid aside all private feeling, and recommended his immediate arrest.

 This proposition was too bold to meet the views of the more timid majority of the committee, and the governor was allowed to flee from the State. Had the proposition of Mr. Middleton been carried into effect, much bloodshed might have been saved in South Carolina, for Lord Campbell, after his flight joined Sir Henry Clinton, and representing the Tory interest as very powerful in that State, induced that commander, in connection with the fleet of Sir Peter Parker, to savage the coast and make an attack upon Charleston. In that engagement Lord Campbell was slain.</string>

			<string>When, in 1779, South Carolina was invaded by the British, Mr. Middleton's property was exposed to their ravages. Yet he heeded not the destruction that was wrought, but joining Governor Rutledge in his attempts to defend the State, he left his estate entirely unprotected and only wrote to his wife to remove with the family a day's journey from the scene of strife. In this invasion a large portion of his immense estate was sacrificed. The following year, after the surrender of Charleston to the British, he was one of the many influential men who were taken prisoners and sent to St. Augustine in Florida. There he remained about one year, and was then sent, as an exchanged prisoner, to Philadelphia. He was at once elected by the Assembly of South Carolina, a representative in Congress, and he remained there until November 1782, when he returned to his family.</string>

The delegation from Pennsylvania then present were equally divided in opinion upon the subject of independence, and Mr. Morton was called upon officially to give a casting vote for that State. This was a solemn responsibility thrown upon him -- it was for him to decide whether there should be an unanimous vote of the Colonies for independence -- whether Pennsylvania should form one of the American Union. But he firmly met the responsibility, and voted YES; and from that moment the United Colonies were declared Independent States. We have said the delegation from Pennsylvania were divided. It was thus: Morris and Dickenson were absent, and Franklin and Wilson were in favor of, and Willing and Humphrey were opposed to, the Declaration; and Morton gave the casting vote.</string>

			<string>In the spring of 1777, Mr. Nelson was seized with an alarming illness, which confined its attack chiefly to his head, and nearly deprived him, for a time, of his powers of memory. His friends urged him to withdraw from Congress for the purpose of recruiting his health, but he was loath to desert his post. He was, however, compelled to leave Philadelphia, and he returned to Virginia to recruit, with the hope and expectation of speedily resuming his seat in Congress. But his convalescence was slow, and when the convention met, he resigned his seat and retired to private life. But he was not suffered long to remain there, for the appearance of a British fleet off the coast of Virginia, and the contemplated attack of the enemy upon the almost defenseless seaboard, called him into the field at the head of the militia of the State. The alarm soon subsided, for the fleet of Lord Howe, instead of landing a force upon Virginia, sailed up the Chesapeake bay for the purpose of making an attack, by land, upon Philadelphia.

 About this time, the financial embarrassments of Congress caused that body to make an appeal to the young men of the Union, of wealth and character, to aid in recruiting the army, and otherwise assisting their country. Mr. Nelson entered heartily into the measure, and by the free use of his influence and purse, he raised a volunteer corps, who placed him at their head, and proceeded to join Washington at Philadelphia. Their services were not called into requisition, and they returned home, hearing the honor of a vote of thanks from Congress. The physical activity which this expedition produced, had an excellent effect upon General Nelson's health, and in 1779, he consented to be again elected a delegate to the Continental Congress. He took his seat in February, but a second attack of his old complaint obliged him to leave it in April, and return home. In May, the predatory operations of the enemy upon the coast, in burning Portsmouth, and threatening Norfolk and other places, caused General Nelson again to resume the services of the field. He collected a large force and proceeded to Yorktown, but the fleet of the enemy soon afterward returned to New York.</string>

He at once begged them not to make any difference on that account, and at once a well directed tire was opened upon it.

			<string>Caesar Rodney was born at Dover, in the Province of Delaware in the year 1730. He was descended from English ancestry. His grandfather came from England soon after William Penn commenced the settlement of Pennsylvania. After remaining a short time in Philadelphia, and forming acquaintances with some of its most esteemed citizens, he went into the county of Kent, on the Delaware, and settled down upon a plantation. He was an active man, and becoming very popular, he held many posts of honor and distinction in that Province. He had several sons, but lost them all except his youngest, Caesar, the father of the subject of this memoir. Unambitious of public honors, and preferring the quiet of domestic life to the bustle and turmoil of the political field, he declined all offices that were tendered to him; and in the midst of agricultural pursuits he enriched his mind by study, and prepared his children for the duties of life.

He remained a prisoner nearly a year, and was then exchanged and set at liberty. It was a gloomy time for the patriots, and the stoutest hearts began to quail. The bulk of the southern army, under Lincoln, had been made prisoners. But still hope did not quite expire, and the successes of Greene, and the victories of Marion and Sumpter, reanimated the fainting hearts of the republicans.</string>

			<string>Alter the fall of Charleston, and the capture of Lincoln and the American army, Cornwallis became fearful of the influence of many citizens, and finally adopted a most cowardly measure. By his order, the Lieutenant Governor (Gadsden), most of the civil and military officers, and some others of the friends of the republicans, of character, were taken out of their beds and houses by armed parties, and collected at the Exchange, when they were conveyed on board a guard-ship, and transported to St. Augustine. Mr. Rutledge was one of the number. His mother did not escape the persecutions of their masters. Cornwallis also feared her talents and influence, and compelled her to leave her country residence and move into the city, where she would be more directly under the vigilant eye of his minions.</string>

			<string>After the British evacuated Charleston in 1781, Mr. Rutledge retired, and resumed the practice of his profession; and for about seventeen years, his time was alternately employed in the duties of his business and service in the Legislature of his State. In the latter capacity he uniformly opposed every proposition for extending the evils of slavery. As a means of relief to those who, during the war, had lost a great many slaves, and were pressed for payment by those of whom they were purchased on credit, it was proposed to import a sufficient number, either from the West Indies, or from Africa direct, to make up the deficiency. All such evil propositions met no favor from Edward Rutledge.</string>

But he did not live to serve out his official term. He had suffered much from hereditary gout, and on returning to Charleston after the adjournment of the Legislature, which sat at Columbia, he caught a severe cold, that brought on a paroxysm of his disease and terminated his life on the twenty-third day of January, in the year 1800.</string>

			<string>Mr. Smith early perceived the gathering storm which British oppressions were elaborating here; and when men began to speak out fearlessly, he was among the first in Pennsylvania to take sides with the patriots of Massachusetts and Virginia. He heartily seconded the proposition for non-importation agreements, and for a General Congress. He was a delegate from the county of York to the Pennsylvania convention (which was styled the Committee of Pennsylvania and later superseded by Pennsylvania's Colonial Assembly), whose duty it was to ascertain the sentiments of the people, and publish an address. Mr. Smith was a member of the subcommittee chosen to prepare the address, which was in the form of instructions to the representatives of the people in the General Assembly of the state. He was earnest in endeavoring to arouse the people to positive resistance, and as early as 1774, he was in favor of cutting the bond that held the colonies to the British throne.</string>

			<string>In the spring of 1777, Mr. Smith declined a reelection to Congress, and resumed his professional business at York; but the unfortunate defeats of the Americans at the Brandywine and at Germantown, and the capture of Philadelphia by the British, called for his valuable presence in the national council, and he obeyed the voice of duty. Congress adjourned to Lancaster when Howe's army took Philadelphia, and afterward it adjourned to York, the place of Mr. Smith's residence. When the battle of Monmouth, in 1778, made the hope of American triumph beam brightly, Mr. Smith retired again from Congress, and resumed his professional business. In 1779 he was called to a seat in the Legislature of Pennsylvania, where he served one term, and then withdrew. This closed his public career, and he lived in the enjoyment of domestic happiness until his death, which occurred on the eleventh day of July, 1806. He is supposed to have been nearly ninety years of age.</string>

He was always lively in his conversation and manners, except when religious subjects were the topics, when he was very grave and never suffered any in his presence to sneer at or speak with levity of Christianity. Although not a professor of religion, he was a possessor of many of its sublimer [sic] virtues, and practiced its holiest precepts.</string>

Such was the case of Thomas Stone, the subject of this brief sketch, whose unassuming manners and attachment to domestic life kept him in apparent obscurity except when called forth by the commands of duty.</string>

			<string>Soon after commencing the practice of his profession, Mr. Walton became acquainted with some of the leading patriots in that province, among whom was Dr. Hall; and they found in him an apt pupil in the school of patriotism. His law tutor was an ardent patriot also, and these influences, combined with his own natural bias, made him espouse the republican cause with hearty zeal. He boldly opposed the movements of the loyalists, and soon called down upon his head the denunciations of the ruling powers. He labored assiduously to have the whole province take the road toward freedom, which the parish of St. John had chosen, yet his labor seemed almost fruitless. But at length the fruits of the zeal of himself and others began to appear, and in the winter of 1776, the Assembly of Georgia declared for the patriot cause, and in February appointed five delegates to the Continental Congress. Of these delegates, Mr. Walton was one.

The royal governor was so incensed at this daring and treasonable act of the Assembly that he threatened to use military force against them. But they utterly disregarded his authority, organized a new government, and elected Archibald Bullock president of the Executive Council.</string>

This was a post of great trust and danger, and the powers delegated to the committee were almost unlimited; in their keeping and disposition nearly the whole of the finances of Congress were entrusted.

			<string>George Wythe was one of Virginia's most distinguished sons. He was born in the year 1726, in Elizabeth county, and being the child of wealthy parents, he had every opportunity given him which the colony afforded for acquiring a good education. His father died when he was quite young, and his education and moral training devolved upon his mother, a woman of superior abilities. She was very proficient in the Latin language, and she aided him much in the study of the classics. But before he was twenty-one years of age, death deprived him of her guidance and instruction; and he was left at that early period of life with a large fortune and the entire control of his own actions. His character not having become fixed, he launched out upon the dangerous sea of pleasure and dissipation, and for ten years of the morning of his life he laid aside study and sought only personal gratification.</string>

He mourned over his misspent days, even in his old age which was clustered round with honors, and he felt intensely the truth of the assertion that 'time once lost, is lost forever.' He at once commenced a course of study, preparatory to entering upon the profession of the law, and he became a student in the office of Mr. Jones, then one of the most distinguished lawyers in the colony. He was admitted to the bar in 1757, and rose rapidly to eminence, not only as an able advocate, but as a strictly conscientious one, for he would never knowingly engage in an unjust cause.</string>
