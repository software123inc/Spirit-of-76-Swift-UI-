			<string>There were many calls for abolition of slavery prior to America's Civil War. In Virginia, Richard Henry Lee's first debate was to take a passionate position to tax the importation of slaves to the point of ending it's practice. Thomas Jefferson, too, made strong but unsuccessful efforts in the Virginia Assembly for the emancipation of the slaves. In 1774, Governor Hopkins introduced a bill into the Assembly of Rhode Island to prevent the importation of slaves; and to show that his professions on this point were sincere, he manumitted all of those which belonged to himself. In connection with Rufus King of New York, William Ellery made strong efforts in 1785 to have slavery in the United States abolished.</string>

For example, when a British force led by Governor Tryon of New York invaded the shores of Connecticut, it began to plunder and desolate the area. Fairfield and Norwalk were laid in ashes, and the most cruel atrocities were inflicted on the inhabitants, without regard to sex or condition. Houses were rifled, the persons of females abused, and many of them fled half naked to the woods and swamps in the vicinity of their desolated homes.</string>

			<string>The five Indian Tribes, the Mohawks, the Oncidas, the Onondagas, the Cayugas, and the Senecas, had formed a confederation long before they were discovered by the whites. It is not known when this confederation was first formed, but when New England settlers penetrated westward, they found this powerful confederacy strongly united, and at war with nearly all of the surrounding tribes.

The Six Nations uniformly took sides with the British, and entered into a compact with them against the French in 1754. In the war of the Revolution, 'the whole confederacy,' says De Witt Clinton, 'except a little more than half the Oneidas, took up arms against us. They hung like the scythe of Death upon the rear of our settlements, and their deeds are inscribed, with the scalping knife, and the tomahawk, in characters of blood, on the fields of Wyoming, and Cherry Valley, and on the banks of the Mohawk.'</string>

			<string>The amount of paper money issued by Congress before the close of 1779 amounted to about two hundred million dollars. The consequence of such an issue was a well grounded suspicion that the bills would not ultimately be redeemed; and this suspicion, at the close of 1779, became so much a certainty, that the notes depreciated to about one fourth of their value. An attempt was made by Congress to make these bills a legal tender at their nominal value, but the measure was soon perceived to be mischievous, and they were left to their fate.</string>

			<string>That party names of Tory and Whig were first used in New York in 1774, and rapidly spread throughout the Colonies. Then name of Tory was applied to the American royalists, and the name of Whig was assumed by the patriots. The origin of these names, (which were copied from the English) is obscure.

The Tories of the Revolution were far more despised (and justly so) by the patriots, than the mercenary troops of Great Britain. They not only lifted their hands against their own brethren, but in many cases their treachery and cruelty exceeded the worst acts of the British soldiery. During the winter, when the American army was suffering every thing but death at Valley Forge, the interior of Pennsylvania swarmed with Tories; and when Washington, by order of Congress, proceeded to take, by force, the grain and other food which the Tory farmers refused to sell to the army, they, in some instances, burnt their produce, rather than have it feed the starving Americans!</string>

			<string>One of the measures adopted by the Colonists to force Great Britain to do them justice following the Stamp Act and the Tea Act, was that of American merchants everywhere agreeing not to import anything from the mother-country. This had a powerful effect upon Parliament (for in the lower House the mercantile interest was strongly represented) and led to the modification of several stringent measures. These agreements, of course, seriously affected merchants here, and therein their patriotism was made peculiarly manifest.</string>

			<string>The Committees of Correspondence constituted a powerful agent in the great of the Revolution. Their conception was simultaneous in Massachusetts and Virginia, and both States claim the honor of priority. At first these committees were confined to the larger cities, but very speedily every village hamlet had its auxiliary committees, and the high moral tone evinced by the Chiefs, ran through all the gradations, from the polished committees appointed by Colonial Assemblies, to the rustic, yet not the least patriotic ones of the interior towns; and through these made an impression upon the whole American people. Thus the patriot heart of America, at this crisis (1773), beat as with one pulsation, and the public mind was fully prepared to act with promptness and decision when circumstances should call for action.

Mr. Lee is doubtless due the credit of first suggesting the system of 'Committees of Correspondence,' although Virginia and Massachusetts both claim the honor of publicly proposing the measure first. So far as that claim is concerned, the proposition was almost simultaneous in the Assembly of both Provinces. It was proposed in the Virginia Assembly, on the twelfth of March, 1773, by Dabney Carr, a brother-in-law of Mr. Jefferson, and a young man of brilliant talents. The plan, however, was fixed on in a caucus at the 'Raleigh Tavern,' and Richard Henry Lee was one of the number. But in a letter to John Dickenson, of Pennsylvania, dated July twenty-fifth, 1768, Mr. Lee proposed the system of 'Corresponding Committees,' as a powerful instrument in uniting the sentiments of the colonists on the great political questions constantly arising to view.</string>

			<string>At the early stage of the controversy with Great Britain, Georgia, sparsely populated, seemed quite inactive, except in the district known as the parish of St. John. There all the patriotism of the province seemed to have been concentrated. The General Assembly having refused to send delegates to the Congress of 1774, that parish separated from the province, and appointed a representative in the Continental Congress. The leaven, however, soon spread, and Georgia gave her vote, in 1776, for independence.

 The people of the parish of St. John, convinced that the rest of the province was too apathetic to act, appealed to the Committee of Safety of South Carolina to allow them to join with them in their non-importation agreements, and other commercial regulations. Owing to some difference of opinion they were not successful in their application. They therefore united among themselves, established a non-importation association, and proceeded to elect a delegate to Congress.</string>

			<string>After the capture of Cornwallis and his army at Yorktown, in 1781, the war virtually ceased. Armies were still on duty, and arrangements were made for regular campaigns the ensuing season; but unimportant skirmishes in the Southern States made up the bulk of actual hostilities from that time until the proclamation of peace. Georgia was the only rendezvous of the remnant of the British at the South, in the beginning of the year 1782. In June of that year, General Wayne arrived there with a portion of the Pennsylvania line, and the enemy retreated from all their outposts into Savannah. The State was thus evacuated, and republican authority was reestablished. Wayne was attacked within five miles of Savannah, on the twenty-fourth of June, by a party of British and Indians, and in that skirmish Colonel John Laurens was killed. This was the last battle of the Revolution. Cessation of hostilities was proclaimed, and in July the British force evacuated Savannah, and the last hostile foot left the soil of Georgia.</string>

This was the phase in which they appeared to Mr. Hooper, and thus regarding them, he felt it his duty to oppose them and maintain good order in the State.

Although the Regulators were men moving in the common walks of life, (and doubtless many vagabonds enrolled themselves among them), yet the rules of government they adopted, the professions they made, and the practices they exhibited, all bear the impress of genuine patriotism; and we cannot but regard the blood shed on the occasion by the infamous Tryon, as the blood of the early martyrs of our Revolution.</string>

But, in 1691, the 'three Lower Counties on the Delaware,' dissatisfied with some of the proceedings of the Executive Council, withdrew from the Union, with the reluctant consent of the proprietor, who appointed a deputy governor over them. The next year, the Provincial government was taken from William Penn, by a royal commission to Governor Fletcher, of New York, who reunited Delaware to Pennsylvania, under the name of the 'Territory of the three Lower Counties on the Delaware.' It remained subordinate to Pennsylvania until 1776, yet having a separate Legislature of its own.</string>

			<string>In 1681, William Penn, a member of the Society of Friends, or Quakers, and son of the English Admiral of that name, obtained a grant from Charles II for all the lands embraced in the present State of Pennsylvania. That region had been colonized by Swedes, nearly forty years before, and Penn issued a proclamation, guaranteeing to permanent settlers undisputed right to the lands they occupied. The great aim of that good man was to establish an empire in the new world, upon the sacred principles of peace and brotherly love, where men of all nations, creeds, and hues, might live together as one harmonious family. Had the policy of William Penn, in conciliating the Indians by uniform kindness of treatment, been followed in the other colonies, much bloodshed might have been prevented, and the settlements would sooner have become permanent and prosperous. During the entire time that William Penn was proprietor of Pennsylvania, not a single dispute occurred with the natives.</string>

			<string>It cannot be denied that the treatment of the Indian tribes at the hands of the whites, in a large majority of cases, has been such that it is not to be wondered at that the untutored mind of the savage should, in its excited workings, elaborate schemes of revenge, a sentiment growing out of injuries received, and a jealous foreboding of future expulsion from their hunting grounds and the graves of their fathers. Although unchristian and savage, yet the Indian possesses the sentiment of patriotism, and reveres the land of his fathers; and among no people upon earth is veneration for the resting place of the dead more strongly exhibited than by him. No wonder, then, that the vision of expatriation, perhaps annihilation, which the future revealed, should have made him arise in his might, and by the tomahawk and torch attempt to stay the flood of white settlement, whose surges beat so strongly against the feeble barriers of his already contracted domain. Had the law of kindness and the principle of justice always prevailed, as they did under the mild and prosperous rule of William Penn, the Indian would have been the white man's friend, and those dark pictures of fire and blood would never have appeared among the delineations of our eventful history.</string>

			<string>Mr. John Dickenson was, at the time of the Revolution, one of the most eminent lawyers in America. He was a powerful writer, and his Letters of a Pennsylvania Farmer were very instrumental in bringing on that crisis in public affairs in the Colonies which brought about the Revolution. He was always opposed to the proposition for independence, and would have voted against it if he had been in his seat on the fourth of July, 1776. His earnest desire was to obtain justice for America, without dismembering the British empire.</string>

			<string>As soon as France, by the treaty of February, 1778, openly declared in favor of the United States, she promptly commenced the fulfillment of her agreement, by fitting out a fleet of twelve sail of the line and sent them to America, under Count D'Estaing. She also appointed a minister (Mr. Gerard) to Congress, and he came with the French fleet, and was landed at Sandy Hook, in July of that year.</string>

			<string>It has been said that the paragraph commencing the with the words 'He has waged a cruel war against human nature itself,' etc., was not palatable to those delegates who were slave-holders, and that it was stricken out lest it should be a cause for them to cast a negative vote on the question. But there is not the least shadow of evidence to prove that such selfish motives guided any one in that august assembly. On the contrary, it was high and holy regard for truth and justice, which caused that eloquent paragraph to be stricken out.

The Congress in that Declaration was enumerating those aggressions against the rights and privileges of the colonies, justly chargeable upon George III as an individual, having been done by his personal sanction, or by his delegated representatives. Such being the case, it was manifestly unjust, indeed not strictly true, to charge him with the evils concomitant to slavery and the slave-trade. This trade was begun and carried on long before the reign of even the first George; and it is not known that George III ever gave his assent to anything relating to slavery, except to abolish it and declare the trade a piracy.</string>
