			<string>After Harvard, having chosen the law as a profession, he began his studies with an eminent barrister in Worchester by the name of Putman. There he had the advantage of sound legal instruction, and through Mr. Putnam he became acquainted with many distinguished public men, among whom was Mr. Gridley, the Attorney General. Their first interview awakened sentiments of mutual regard, and young Adams was allowed the free use of Mr. Gridley's extensive library, a privilege of great value in those day. It was a rich treasure thrown open to him, and its value was soon apparent in the expansion of he general knowledge. He was admitted to the bar in 1758, and commenced practice in Braintree. </string>

			<string>Young Bartlett lacked the advantage of a collegiate education, but he improved an opportunity for acquiring some knowledge of Greek and Latin, which was offered to him by the family of a relative, Doctor Webster. He chose for a livelihood the practice of the medical profession, and commenced the study of the science when he was sixteen years old. His opportunities for acquiring knowledge from books were limited, but the active energies of his mind supplied the deficiency, in a measure, and he passed an examination with honor at the close of his studies.</string>

			<string>Mr. Sherman's early education was exceedingly limited, but with a naturally strong and active mind, he acquired a large stock of knowledge from books, during his apprenticeship. It is said that while at work on his bench, he had a book so placed that he could read when it was not necessary for his eyes to be upon his work. He thus acquired a good knowledge of mathematics, and he made astronomical calculations for an almanac that was published in New York when he was only twenty-seven years old.

Not long after he settled in New Milford, he formed a partnership with his brother in a mercantile business, but all the while was very studious. He turned his attention to the study of law, during his leisure hours; and so proficient did he become in legal knowledge, that he was admitted to the bar in December 1754. Mr. Sherman had no instructor or guide in the study of law, neither had he any books but such as he borrowed, yet he became one of the most profound jurists of his day.</string>

			<string>His father was an industrious farmer, and the only education he was able to allow his son was that to be derived from the common schools in his neighborhood. Samuel was very studious, and the active energies of his mind surmounted many obstacles that stood in the way of intellectual advancement.

He acquired a tolerable knowledge of the Latin language, and at the age of twenty-two years he commenced the study of law. Like Sherman, he was obliged to pursue it with borrowed books and without an instructor. He succeeded however, in mastering its difficulties, and in obtaining a good practice in his native town before he was thirty years of age.</string>

Having completed his preparatory studies, William was entered a pupil at Harvard University, where he remained a close and industrious student for three years, and in 1760 he graduated with distinguished honors.

His father designed him for the clerical profession, but as he evinced a decided preference for the bar, he was placed as a student in the office of the celebrated James Otis. On the completion of his studies, perceiving that the profession was quite full of practicians [sic] in Massachusetts, he went to North Carolina, where many of his Scotch relations resided, and began business in that province in 1767.</string>

On the death of his father, the Reverend Mr. Maury became his preceptor; and in the spring of 1760, he entered William and Mary College, where he remained two years. From Doctor William Small, a professor of mathematics in the college, he received his first philosophical teachings, and the bias of his mind concerning subjects of scientific investigation seemed to have received its initial impetus from that gentleman. Through his influence, in 1762, young Jefferson was admitted as a student-at-law in the office of George Wythe, the intimate friend of Governor Fauquier, at whose table our subject became a welcome guest.</string>

Thus he was early indoctrinated with the ideas of republicanism, and before the season of adolescence had passed, he was warmly attached to those principles of civil liberty, which he afterward so manfully contended for.</string>

			<string>Arthur Middleton was born at Middleton Place, the residence of his father, in South Carolina, in 1743. His father, Henry Middleton, was of English descent, and a wealthy planter, and he gave his son every opportunity for mental and moral culture which the Province afforded, until he arrived at a proper age to be sent to England for a thorough education. This was a prevailing custom among the men of wealth in the southern provinces, previous to the Revolution, and their sons consequently became political and social leaders, on account of their superior education.

 Arthur was sent to England, when he was about twelve years of age, and was placed in a school at Hackney (Several of the Southern members of Congress received their education at this school, preparatory to their entering the college at Cambridge.). At fourteen he was transferred to a school in Westminster, where he remained four years, and then entered the University at Cambridge. While there, he shunned the society of the frivolent [sic] and dissipated, and became a very close and thoughtful student. He remained at Cambridge four years, and at the age of twenty-two, he graduated with distinguished honors. He carried with him, from that institution, the sincere respect and esteem of professors and students.</string>

			<string>John Penn's father, Moses Penn, seemed to be utterly neglectful of the intellectual cultivation of his son; and, although he possessed the means of giving him a good English education, he allowed him no other opportunity than that which two or three years' tuition in a common county school in his neighborhood afforded. Mr. Penn died when his son was about eighteen years of age, and left him the sole possessor of a competent, though not large estate.</string>

			<string>Young Penn was a relative of the celebrated Edmund Pendleton, and resided near him. That gentleman kindly gave him the free use of his extensive library, and this opportunity for acquiring knowledge was industriously improved. He resolved to qualify himself for the profession of the law, and strong in his faith that he should be successful, he entered upon a course of legal study, guided and instructed only by his own judgment and good common sense. He succeeded admirably, and at the age of twenty-one years, he was admitted to the bar, in his native county. His profession soon developed a native eloquence before inert and unsuspected, and by it, in connection with close application to business, he rapidly soared to eminence. His eloquence was of that sweet persuasive kind, which excites all the tender emotions of the soul, and possesses a controlling power at times irresistible.</string>

			<string>George Walton's early education was extremely limited, and at the age of fourteen years he was apprenticed to a carpenter. He was possessed of an inquiring mind, and an ardent thirst for knowledge, but his master's authority hung like a millstone about the neck of his aspirations. He was an ignorant man, and looked upon a studious boy as an idle one, considering the time spent in reading as wasted. With this feeling, he would allow young Walton no time to read by day, nor lights to study by night; but the ardent youth overcame these difficulties, and by using torch-wood for light, he spent his evenings in study. Persevering in this course, he ended his apprenticeship with a well-stored mind. He then moved into the province of Georgia, and commenced the study of law in the office of Mr. Young, an eminent barrister in that colony.</string>
